-an electrical signal is sent to our computer.
-The operating system of the computer get this signal and translates it into a an ASCII code for the letter "g."
 -then the application or software that we are using(text editor, web browser) processed This ASCII code .
-The application displays the letter "g" on the screen using the received code.

This  process happens in quickly in a second or less.
